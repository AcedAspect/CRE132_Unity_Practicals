# Session 02: Operators & Control Flow

## 🎯 **Learning Focus**
This session teaches students how to use mathematical operators, detect user input, and make decisions using conditional logic (if/else statements).

## 📚 **Core Concepts Covered**
- **Mathematical Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo)
- **Assignment Operators**: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`
- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- **Logical Operators**: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)
- **Unity Input System**: `Input.GetKeyDown()`, `Input.GetKey()`, `Input.GetMouseButtonDown()`
- **Conditional Logic**: `if`, `else`, `else if` statements
- **Boolean Logic**: Working with `true`/`false` values

## 📁 **Files in This Session**

### **📖 Instructional Materials**
- **`Session02_Practical.md`** - Complete practical guide with step-by-step instructions
- **`README.md`** - This overview file

### **💡 Demonstration Scripts**
- **`MathOperators.cs`** - Shows all mathematical operations and practical calculations
- **`InputDetection.cs`** - Demonstrates keyboard and mouse input detection
- **`ConditionalLogic.cs`** - Shows if/else statements and boolean logic in action

### **✏️ Student Exercise**
- **`Session02_StudentExercise.cs`** - Student template with TODO sections to complete

## 🎮 **What Students Will Build**
Students complete an interactive exercise that includes:

1. **Personal Calculator** - Using if/else statements to perform different mathematical operations
2. **Character Analysis System** - Analyzing game character stats with conditional logic
3. **Input Detection System** - Responding to keyboard and mouse input
4. **Complex Decision Making** - Combining multiple conditions with logical operators

## 🛠️ **Setup Instructions**
1. Create a new scene called `02_Operators_Control_Flow`
2. Create an empty GameObject called `Session02Manager`
3. Attach the demonstration scripts to test the concepts
4. Create a separate GameObject for the student exercise

## ✅ **Learning Outcomes**
By completing this session, students will be able to:
- Perform mathematical calculations in their code
- Compare values and make decisions based on conditions
- Detect and respond to user input (keyboard and mouse)
- Write complex conditional logic using multiple operators
- Combine conditions using AND, OR, and NOT logic
- Create interactive game systems that respond to player actions

## 🔗 **Connects To**
- **Previous**: Session 01 (C# Fundamentals) - Uses variables and basic syntax
- **Next**: Session 03 (Loops & Methods) - Will use conditional logic in loops and custom methods

## 🎯 **Key Practical Applications**
- Game character status systems (health, level, equipment checks)
- Player input handling (movement, jumping, attacking)
- Resource management (ammo, inventory, currency)
- Game state management (pause, game over, level completion)
- Enemy AI decision making
- User interface interactions

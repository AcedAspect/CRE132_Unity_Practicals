# Session 04: Collections & Movement

## üéØ **Session Overview**
Master data management and object movement! This session covers arrays for fixed collections, lists for dynamic data, Unity's Transform system, and essential 2D movement patterns that form the foundation of interactive games.

## üìö **What You'll Learn**

### **Core Concepts**
- **Arrays**: Fixed-size collections perfect for spawn points, difficulty levels, and static data
- **Lists**: Dynamic collections that grow and shrink - ideal for inventories, enemies, and projectiles
- **Unity Transform**: Position, rotation, and scale manipulation for GameObjects
- **Vector3**: 3D positioning, directions, and mathematical operations
- **Movement Patterns**: WASD controls, mouse following, circular motion, and patrol systems
- **Input Systems**: Keyboard and mouse input for player control

### **Practical Applications**
- Player and enemy movement systems
- Inventory and item management
- Spawn point systems and enemy formations
- Projectile management and physics
- UI element positioning and animation
- Camera following and smooth movement

## üéÆ **Key Game Development Applications**

### **Collections in Action**
```csharp
// Fixed spawn points using arrays
Vector3[] enemySpawns = {
    new Vector3(-5f, 2f, 0f),
    new Vector3(5f, 2f, 0f),
    new Vector3(0f, -3f, 0f)
};

// Dynamic inventory using lists
List<string> playerInventory = new List<string>();
playerInventory.Add("Health Potion");
playerInventory.Remove("Broken Sword");
```

### **Movement Magic**
```csharp
// Smooth player movement
float horizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
float vertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
Vector3 movement = new Vector3(horizontal, vertical, 0f);
transform.position += movement * speed * Time.deltaTime;

// Follow target smoothly
transform.position = Vector3.MoveTowards(
    transform.position, 
    target.position, 
    speed * Time.deltaTime
);
```

### **Transform Power**
```csharp
// Position, rotate, and scale objects
transform.position = new Vector3(5f, 3f, 0f);
transform.Rotate(Vector3.forward * 45f);
transform.localScale = Vector3.one * 2f;
```

## üéØ **Learning Progression**

### **Beginner Level**
- ‚úÖ Create and access arrays with proper indexing
- ‚úÖ Add and remove items from Lists
- ‚úÖ Move objects using transform.position
- ‚úÖ Handle basic WASD input

### **Intermediate Level**
- ‚úÖ Process collections with loops and find specific elements
- ‚úÖ Use Vector3 operations for distance and direction calculations
- ‚úÖ Implement smooth movement with Time.deltaTime
- ‚úÖ Create boundary systems and collision detection

### **Advanced Level**
- ‚úÖ Build complex movement patterns (circular, patrol, mouse-follow)
- ‚úÖ Manage dynamic collections of GameObjects
- ‚úÖ Combine input systems with Transform manipulation
- ‚úÖ Create complete movement controllers with multiple modes

## üö® **Common Challenges & Solutions**

### **Array Index Errors**
```csharp
// ‚ùå DANGER - Can cause crashes!
int value = myArray[10]; // What if array only has 5 elements?

// ‚úÖ SAFE - Always check bounds
if (index >= 0 && index < myArray.Length)
{
    int value = myArray[index];
}
```

### **Stuttery Movement**
```csharp
// ‚ùå BAD - Framerate dependent
transform.position += Vector3.right * speed;

// ‚úÖ GOOD - Smooth movement
transform.position += Vector3.right * speed * Time.deltaTime;
```

### **List Null Reference**
```csharp
// ‚ùå DANGER - Uninitialized list
List<string> items;
items.Add("Sword"); // CRASH!

// ‚úÖ SAFE - Always initialize
List<string> items = new List<string>();
items.Add("Sword"); // Works perfectly
```

## üí° **Best Practices**

### **Collection Guidelines**
- **Use Arrays for**: Fixed spawn points, difficulty settings, predetermined values
- **Use Lists for**: Dynamic inventories, active enemies, projectiles, quest items
- Always initialize collections before use
- Check bounds and null references
- Use foreach for reading, for loops when you need the index

### **Movement Design**
- Always multiply movement by `Time.deltaTime` for frame-rate independence
- Use `Input.GetAxis()` for smooth analog movement
- Implement boundary checking to keep objects on screen
- Consider using `Vector3.MoveTowards()` for constant speed movement
- Use `Vector3.Lerp()` for smooth easing movement

### **Transform Best Practices**
- Cache frequently used transforms in variables
- Use `Vector3.right`, `Vector3.up` instead of `new Vector3(1,0,0)`
- Understand world vs local space differences
- Use `transform.Translate()` for relative movement
- Consider performance - transform operations can be expensive in Update()

   - Reset positions with context menu

## üöÄ **Next Steps**
After mastering collections and movement, you'll be ready for **Session 05: OOP Basics**, where you'll learn:
- Classes and objects for better code organization
- Constructors for initializing game entities
- Access modifiers for data protection
- Building reusable component systems

## üéØ **Real-World Applications**

### **Game Systems You Can Build**
- **Player Controllers**: Complete movement systems with multiple input methods
- **Inventory Management**: Dynamic item collection with add/remove functionality

- **Waypoint Navigation**: AI that follows predetermined paths
- **Collection Games**: Pickup systems with score tracking

### **Performance Tips**
- Initialize Lists with capacity when you know the approximate size
- Use `RemoveAt()` instead of `Remove()` when you have the index
- Cache `transform` references to avoid repeated lookups
- Consider object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Use `sqrMagnitude` instead of `magnitude` for distance comparisons

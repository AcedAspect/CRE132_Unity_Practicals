# CRE132 Unity Beginner Coding Course

# CRE132 Unity Beginner Coding Course

## Welcome Students! 🎮

This Unity project contains interactive coding exercises to teach you C# programming through game development. Each session focuses on specific programming concepts while building fun, playable examples.

## 📚 **Course Structure**

The course is divided into **8 focused sessions**:

1. **C# Fundamentals** - Syntax, variables, data types, comments
2. **Operators & Control Flow** - Operators, input, if/else, booleans  
3. **Loops & Methods** - For/while loops, strings, method creation
4. **Collections & Movement** - Arrays, lists, Unity Transform
5. **OOP Basics** - Classes, objects, constructors, access modifiers
6. **Advanced OOP** - Inheritance, polymorphism, game systems  
7. **Interfaces & Management** - Interfaces, switch, game states
8. **Data & Final Project** - File I/O, persistence, complete mini-game

## 🎯 **How to Use This Course**

### **For Each Session:**
1. **Navigate** to the session folder (e.g., `Session01/`)
2. **Read** the practical guide (`SessionXX_Practical.md`) - includes detailed Unity and code editor instructions
3. **Study** the example scripts provided
4. **Complete** the student exercise with step-by-step TODO guidance
5. **Test** your work in Unity using the Console window

### **🔑 Important: Unity and Visual Studio Code Integration**
This course teaches you both C# programming AND how to work professionally with development tools:

#### **Unity Skills You'll Master:**
- Navigating the Unity interface and project structure
- Attaching scripts to GameObjects
- Using the Console window to see your code output and debug errors
- Modifying variables through the Inspector
- Testing your code by pressing Play

#### **Visual Studio Code Skills You'll Master:**  
- Opening and editing C# scripts from Unity
- Understanding syntax highlighting (green=comments, blue=keywords, red=strings)
- Completing TODO sections with exact code examples provided
- Saving your work and testing it immediately in Unity
- Recognising and fixing common coding errors

**Session 1 provides comprehensive guidance on both tools - don't skip it!**

## 🚀 **What You'll Build**

By the end of this course, you'll have created:
- **Interactive demonstrations** of every major C# concept
- **Playable mini-games** showing practical applications
- **A final project** integrating all learned concepts
- **A solid foundation** for continued game development

## 📁 **Project Organisation**

- `Core/` - Reusable systems and managers (you'll build these later)
- `Player/` - Player-specific functionality
- `UI/` - User interface scripts
- `Utilities/` - Helper classes and tools
- `SessionXX/` - Each session's scripts and exercises

## 🔧 **Important Notes**

### **Unity Basics You Need:**
- How to create GameObjects
- How to attach scripts to GameObjects  
- How to use the Console window (`Window > General > Console`)
- How to use the Inspector to modify public variables

### **Don't Worry If:**
- You've never programmed before - this course starts from scratch!
- Unity seems complicated - we'll only use what we need
- You make mistakes - errors are part of learning!

## ✅ **Success Tips**

1. **Follow the sessions in order** - each builds on the previous
2. **Actually type the code** - don't just read it
3. **Test frequently** - press Play often to see your changes
4. **Read the error messages** - they usually tell you what's wrong
5. **Experiment** - try changing values and see what happens

## 🆘 **Getting Help**

### **Common Issues:**
- **Red errors in Console**: Usually missing semicolons or spelling mistakes
- **Variables don't show in Inspector**: Make sure they're `public`
- **Nothing happens when I press Play**: Check the Console for error messages

### **Resources:**
- **Unity Console**: `Window > General > Console` - shows `Debug.Log()` output and errors
- **Inspector**: Select a GameObject to see and modify its public variables
- **Your practical guides**: Each session has troubleshooting sections

## 🏆 **Learning Philosophy**

This course emphasises:
- **Code-first approach**: Understanding programming logic before fancy graphics
- **Hands-on learning**: Every concept has interactive examples
- **Real application**: Everything connects to actual game development
- **Building confidence**: Start simple, grow complexity gradually

## W3Schools Alignment ✅

This course comprehensively covers **ALL** W3Schools C# concepts within a Unity game development context, ensuring you gain both programming fundamentals and practical game development skills.
